# CrowdCounting

Modified version of https://github.com/ZhihengCV/Bayesian-Crowd-Counting that uses the JHU-CROWD++ dataset to extend the previous training made on the Shanghai-A dataset.
The repo contains modified .py files necessary to the handling of .txt labels, the testing of images without labels and to the plotting of the outputs.

This version provides a video-based demo (instead of a gif):

Other demo are available <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19_CpHtIcGjnDGUilf86XJyiZ85kFlNWM?usp=sharing"> HERE </a>
If you want to test the model, first download the notebook (file .ipynb).
