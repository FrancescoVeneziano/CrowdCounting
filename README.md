# CrowdCounting

Modified version of https://github.com/ZhihengCV/Bayesian-Crowd-Counting that uses the JHU-CROWD++ dataset to extend the previous training made on the Shanghai-A dataset.
The repo contains modified .py files necessary to the handling of .txt labels, the testing of images without labels and to the plotting of the outputs.

Example of a .gif output:
